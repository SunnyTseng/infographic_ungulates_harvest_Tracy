## Title

> Ungulate occurrence in forest harvest blocks is influenced by forage availability, surrounding habitat, and silviculture practices

Q: Can there be a shorter version of the title? Something like "Ungulate occurrence in forest harvest blocks: implications on caribou protection"

Q: Is it possible to get some camera pictures for deers, elk and moose as drawing references? 
 
## Introduction

> Distribution and abundance of deer, elk, and moose can be shifted by forest harvesting, thus influencing caribou predation by shared predators like bears, cougars, and wolves. The reduction of ungulate prey species within caribou ranges is desired. In this research, we determined how harvest block characteristics influence ungulate use of harvest blocks.

 

## Methods

> We used cameras, silviculture data, habitat and disturbance data, and detailed vegetation data collected at harvest blocks to investigate deer, elk, and moose occurrence in harvest blocks.


## Results

> - White-tailed Deer (91%), Mule Deer (49%), elk (39%), and moose (84%) occurrence was higher in summer than winter.

> - Deer, elk, and moose occurrence was higher in younger blocks.

> - Elk, moose, and white-tailed deer occurrence was higher in harvest blocks with greater availability of specific forage species (e.g., deciduous saplings, Canadian reedgrass, willow, and horsetails).

> - Mule deer and white-tailed deer occurrence was lower in blocks with higher planting densities of lodgepole pine.

> - Mule deer occurrence was also lower in blocks that had been stand tended.


## Conclusion

> Higher planting densities and controlling specific forage species as silviculture practices could reduce the use of harvest blocks by ungulates, with the potential to reduce the risk to caribou predation.
