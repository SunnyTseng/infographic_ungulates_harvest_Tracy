## Title

> Predator-prey co-occurrence in harvest blocks: Implications for caribou and forestry


The paper title is already pretty good. I would keep it if we are targeting sciency people, or else rephrase “co-occurrence” for non-sciency people. Could also just state the results/implications such as:

Predators and prey in cutblocks: implications for caribou and forestry
What draws deer, elk, moose, and bears to cutblocks
 
## Introduction

> Forest harvesting affects ungulate prey species and their predators, with cascading impacts on other species, including threatened woodland caribou. We investigated the attributes of harvest blocks associated with the occupancy of ungulates and predators, to inform management practices to limit the distribution and overlap of angulates and predators within caribou ranges. 

This can be cut down a lot. The 2nd sentence isn’t all that useful because it is largely repeating what is already implied by the title, methods, and results. What about:

Moose, deer, and elk are apparent competitors for caribou because they draw predators. Forestry in caribou ranges amplify this effect. We tried to find out how to dampen it.
 

## Methods

> Camera traps and vegetation data. Species include angulates (deer, elk, and moose), and predators (bears, cougars, and wolves)

Could cut altogether. If the purpose of the IG is to tell people the results, then it isn’t needed. If you keep it, it might be  a bit more clear to say:

Trail cameras record deer, elk, moose, bears, cougars, and wolves. We relate wildlife occurrence to cutblock characteristics.
 

## Results

> 1. Occupancy of deer and moose was higher in summer than in winter. 

> 2. Occupancy of deer, elk, moose, and bears was linked to forage species, silviculture practices, and deciduous forest and forest age in the surrounding area. 

> 3. Occupancy of bears was higher in harvest blocks where deers were present, and bear-deer co-occurrence was influenced by silviculture practices and anthropogenic disturbance. 

## Conclusion

> Silviculture practices used to control forage availability could reduce the use of harvest blocks by ungulates, with the potential to reduce the overlap of ungulates and predators within caribou ranges. 

 

I like the first part, but the second half is a bit vague. Could try something like:

… by ungulates, which could reduce the predation risk for caribou.

# 1st edit

Hi Sunny

 

Thank you for your work on this!! It looks great. In the words of Ben (our communications specialist): “This is a really, really good infographic. It’s elegant and thoughtfully designed”.

 

I will be finished at fRI after tomorrow, and Laura will be away for a couple weeks, can you please send the final version to Ben Williamson (cc’d above).

 

A few edits:

 

- Can you space out the first paragraph more  – maybe a new paragraph between ‘effect’ and ‘we related’
- Change the caribou antlers to woodland caribou antlers (they are a different shape and size) [see attached – there are more examples if you seasrch ‘woodland caribou’ in google image]
- Change cutblock to harvest block throughout (it’s the term we use in the paper)
- Change “We related wildlife occurrence to cutblock characteristics…” to “We related wildlife occupancy and co-occurrence to harvest block characteristics…”
- Change “Ungulates population” to “Ungulate population”. Can you also use lower case for ‘population’
- Under ungulates and bears change to: “specific forage species, silviculture practices, surrounding forest age and type”
- change the take home (text at the lower right) to read: “Controlling forage availability could reduce the use of harvest blocks by ungulates and bears, which could reduce predation risk for caribou.”

- At the bottom can you change McKay et al 2022 to McKay and Finnegan 2022. Conserv. Sci. Pract. e12847
