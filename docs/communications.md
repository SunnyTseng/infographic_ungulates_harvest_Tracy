## Title

> Ungulate occurrence in forest harvest blocks is influenced by forage availability, surrounding habitat, and silviculture practices

Can there be a shorter version of the title? 
 
## Introduction

> Silviculture practices applied after forest harvesting directly affect the amount of forage available in harvested areas, and therefore can influence ungulate distribution. A consequence is unsustainable caribou predation by shared predators like bears, cougars, and wolves. Our goal was to determine how harvest block characteristics and specific treatments of site preparation, planting, and stand tending influence ungulate use of har-vest blocks.

 

## Methods

> We used cameras, silviculture data, habitat and disturbance data, and detailed vegetation data collected at harvest blocks to investigate deer, elk, and moose occurrence in harvest blocks.


## Results

> 1. Occupancy of deer and moose was higher in summer than in winter. 

> 2. Occupancy of deer, elk, moose, and bears was linked to forage species, silviculture practices, and deciduous forest and forest age in the surrounding area. 

> 3. Occupancy of bears was higher in harvest blocks where deers were present, and bear-deer co-occurrence was influenced by silviculture practices and anthropogenic disturbance. 

## Conclusion

> Silviculture practices used to control forage availability could reduce the use of harvest blocks by ungulates, with the potential to reduce the overlap of ungulates and predators within caribou ranges.
